# MJCompiler

MJCompiler is a compiler for the **MicroJava** programming language, developed as part of a university course in Compiler Construction. 
It is written in Java and includes all typical phases of a compiler: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, code generation, and error handling.

## Features

- Lexical and syntax analysis using CUP and JFlex
- Symbol table construction and management
- Semantic checks (type checking, scope resolution, etc.)
- Intermediate code generation
- Error reporting with line and column references
- Pretty printing of AST and symbol tables for debugging purposes

## Technologies Used

- Java
- JFlex (for lexical analysis)
- CUP (for syntax analysis)
- Custom data structures and classes for semantic analysis and code generation
